Chrome-Extension From Scratch


(Need it to function on all websites)
// First, gather images of a bunch of annoying (yet PG-13?) ads



// Animate so they actually "Pop Up"



// We need to create a way to exit out of the ads



// Figure out wether we want pop-ups on a timer or to relate to a specific event
